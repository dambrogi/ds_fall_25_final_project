# Exploring Predictors of EV Charger Access

*Intro to Data Science (Fall 2025) Final Project*

*By Drew Ambrogi and Ameenah Habib*

### Overview

This project examines whether public EV charging stations are equitably distributed across U.S. neighborhoods or whether some communities are systematically left behind. Using charger location data pulled via web APIs from NREL, combined with census-tract demographic and housing data, we apply geospatial analysis and supervised machine learning models to assess how neighborhood characteristics shape access to public charging infrastructure.

The project is split into four parts, and we recommend viewing them in the following order:

1.  [Introduction](index.qmd) 
2.  [Codebook and Dependencies](codebook.qmd)
3.  [Data Assembly and Cleaning](assembly.qmd)
4.  [Exploratory Analysis and Modeling](main.qmd)
